# LinHPSDR

### Changelist for this fork

I'm using this software only on Mac OS, so some of this issues can be appeared only on Mac OS and fixes can affect normal working on linux systems :)

1) Added 'space' hotkey to enable MOX in receiver window
2) Replaced spaces in VFO freqency with zeroes (a bit ugly, but working) to fix wrong digit scrolling.
3) Changed default FPS for new receivers to 25.
4) Fix speech processing settings in TX configuration tab (was in wrong position - under equalizer).
5) Trigger waterfall drag event only when we moving mouse more that for a one pixel to prevent unwanted drag event caused by mouse jitter.
6) As I'm using TRX-DUO (Red Pitaya clone)  I'm using att10 and att20 outputs to control filters. So I've just added checkboxes in the configuration window to control those outputs - enable them or disable.
7) Added ppm correction setting.
8) Auto disabling squelch when non FM mode choosen
9) Disable squelch in NFM mode if setting for squelch of too low (there is no button for squelch so using just squelch bar to disable it)
10) Fixed deviation for NFM in receiver window
11) Fix switch tx mode to receiving when changing transmiter
12) Ignore SOAPY protocol for PA calibration settings (display all bands)

### TODO for this fork

1) Add font change setting.
2) Fix waterfall drag (sometimes it jumps on a wrong freq. can be a GTK issue on Mac OS)
3) Save receiver settings when closing window.
4) Pack resources and binary into mac os application.

### Development environment

Development and testing has been run on Ubuntu and Arch Linux. If run on early versions there may be a problem with GTK not supporting the gtk_menu_popup_at_pointer function vfo.c. For information on MacOS support see [MacOS.md](./MacOS.md).

```


### linhpsdr requires WDSP to be built and installed

```
  git clone https://github.com/g0orx/wdsp.git

### CW support

Hermes and HL2 CWX/cwdaemon support added. If you do not wish to use this, please ignore. This features requires the following to be installed (tested on Ubuntu 19.10, Kubuntu 18.04 LTS):

  cd unixcw-code
  git fetch --tags
  git checkout tags/v3.6.0
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig
```
If CWX/cwdaemon is wanted/required. You must enable it in the Makefile. Uncomment the following lines:
```
#CWDAEMON_INCLUDE=CWDAEMON

#ifeq ($(CWDAEMON_INCLUDE),CWDAEMON)
#CWDAEMON_OPTIONS=-D CWDAEMON
#CWDAEMON_LIBS=-lcw
#CWDAEMON_SOURCES= \
#cwdaemon.c
#CWDAEMON_HEADERS= \
#cwdaemon.h
#CWDAEMON_OBJS= \
#cwdaemon.o
#endif
```
